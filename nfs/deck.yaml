    notes: |

      This Deck installs an NFS provisioner as a StatefulSet and provides a PersistentVolumeClaim with name 'nfs' with access mode ReadWriteMany (RWX).
      Additionally two Pods are deployed which both mount this volume. You can verify it working by storing files in the directory /var/nfs on both Pods.
      You can now add your own workload and request either that particular volume or create a new one.
